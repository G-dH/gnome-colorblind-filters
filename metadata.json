  "description": "Color filters are designed to assist both color-blind users and developers. The menu offers correction filters as well as simulation filters that demonstrate how color-blind individuals perceive colors. Included are filters for Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia, with adjustable strength. Additionally, filters for desaturation, channel mix, and lightness and color inversions are available.\n\nPrimary mouse button click on the panel button toggles active filter, secondary click opens configuration menu, middle click toggles high-contrast correction if available and scroll switches filters.\n\nDiscussions and bug reports on the GitHub page linked below, please.",
