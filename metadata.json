  "description": "Color filters that should help color-blind users and developers.\nThe menu includes correction filters and also simulation filters that can show you what color-blind people see. Included are filters for Protanopia, Deuteranopia and Tritanopia, filter strength is adjustable.\n\nLeft click on the panel button toggles the active filter, right click opens configuration menu.\n\nAny feedback and help appreciated. I'm not visually impaired myself, I didn't find any open correction algorithms, I just tried to mimic what the Android filters do and my GLSL and image manipulation skills are very limited, so the results are not perfect.\n\nAny discussions and bug reports on the GitHub page linked below, please.",
